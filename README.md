# simple_memory
An extension to Oobabooga to add a simple memory function for chat

I suck at writing these readme files.

This extension neends to be cloned into your extensions folder, or downloaded the simple_memory folder needs to be palaced into the extensions folder.

Add the following flag to your start script: --extension simple_memory

The memory just adds whatever is in the box to the start of the prompt.  It is part of your token limit.  The settings for the extension are saved between sessions.

Again, like I said, I suck at writing these things.  Good luck!  My the odds ever be in your favor.
